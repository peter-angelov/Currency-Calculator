Time spend:

1. Getting familiar with product: 6h.
2. Providing code as suggestion and automation using AI (Gemini and Claude) - 8h (note: I did list a lot of time here, because for one of the case I intended to provide an automation. Unfortunately the final result was ok from technical point of view, but I found that my logic is wrong. Thus the script is removed from GitHub).
3. Test case creation and issue/suggestions reports - 8h.
4. Test Summary Report: 2h.
